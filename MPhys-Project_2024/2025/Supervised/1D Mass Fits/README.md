# 1D Mass Fits

## Purpose

This directory contains the code for performing 1D mass fits. The purpose of this code is to fit the mass distributions in 1D for different samples.

## Functionality

The code in this directory performs the following tasks:
1. RS 1D Deltam Mass Fit: Fits the Deltam mass distribution for the RS sample.
2. RS 1D D0 Mass Fit: Fits the D0 mass distribution for the RS sample.
3. WS 1D Deltam Mass Fit: Fits the Deltam mass distribution for the WS sample.
4. WS 1D D0 Mass Fit: Fits the D0 mass distribution for the WS sample.

## Code

The cpp code for the 1D mass fits will be added here.
