# 2D Mass Fits Loops for Significance Scan

## Purpose

This directory contains the code for performing 2D mass fits while looping over the cuts of the BDT response. The purpose of this code is to scan for significance in the 2D mass fits.

## Functionality

The code in this directory performs the following tasks:
1. Loops over different cuts of the BDT response.
2. Performs 2D mass fits for each cut.
3. Scans for significance in the 2D mass fits.

## Code

The cpp code for the 2D mass fits looping over the cuts of the BDT response will be added here.
