# 2D Mass Fits

## Purpose

This directory contains the code for performing 2D mass fits. The purpose of this code is to fit the mass distributions in 2D for different samples.

## Functionality

The code in this directory performs the following tasks:
1. RS 2D Mass Fits: Fits the 2D mass distribution for the RS sample.
2. WS 2D Mass Fits: Fits the 2D mass distribution for the WS sample.
3. RS 2D Mass Fits Projections: Projects the 2D mass fits for the RS sample.
4. WS 2D Mass Fits Projections: Projects the 2D mass fits for the WS sample.

## Code

The cpp code for the 2D mass fits will be added here.
