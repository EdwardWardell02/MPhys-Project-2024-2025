# Supervised Section

## Purpose

This section contains codes related to supervised learning methods developed during my MPhys project. 

## Content

Each code in this directory has its own ReadMe file explaining its purpose and functionality. The codes are organized to provide a clear understanding of the supervised learning techniques used in the project.

## List of Codes

1. 2D Mass Fits Loops for Significance Scan
   - `README.md`: Explains the purpose of the directory and the cpp code.
   - `2D_mass_fits.cpp`: Placeholder for the cpp code that performs the 2D mass fits looping over the cuts of the BDT response.
2. 1D Mass Fits
   - `README.md`: Explains the purpose of the directory and the cpp codes.
