# DBSCAN

## Purpose

This directory contains the code for performing DBSCAN clustering on a reference sample (RS) and then applying the centroid of the clusters to a working sample (WS).

## Functionality

The code in this directory performs the following tasks:
1. Clusters the reference sample (RS) using DBSCAN.
2. Calculates the centroids of the clusters.
3. Assigns each point in the working sample (WS) to the nearest centroid.

## Code

The Jupyter notebook for DBSCAN clustering on RS and using centroid, apply to WS will be added here.
