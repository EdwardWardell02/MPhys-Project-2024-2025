# UMAP

## Purpose

This directory contains the code for clustering a UMAP reduced sample with DBSCAN or HDBSCAN and evaluating the clustering performance using various scoring metrics.

## Functionality

The code in this directory performs the following tasks:
1. Reduces the dimensionality of the data using UMAP.
2. Clusters the UMAP reduced data using DBSCAN or HDBSCAN.
3. Evaluates the clustering performance using various scoring metrics.

## Code

The Jupyter notebook for clustering a UMAP reduced sample with DBSCAN or HDBSCAN with scoring is available in this directory.
