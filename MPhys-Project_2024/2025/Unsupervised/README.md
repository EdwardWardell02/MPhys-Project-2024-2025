# Unsupervised Section

## Purpose

This section contains codes related to unsupervised learning methods developed during my MPhys project. 

## Content

Each code in this directory has its own ReadMe file explaining its purpose and functionality. The codes are organized to provide a clear understanding of the unsupervised learning techniques used in the project.

## List of Codes

1. HDBSCAN
   - `DBSCAN_clustering_on_RS_and_using_centroid_apply_to_WS.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook for DBSCAN clustering on RS and using centroid, apply to WS.
2. DBSCAN
   - `DBSCAN_clustering_on_RS_and_using_centroid_apply_to_WS.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook for DBSCAN clustering on RS and using centroid, apply to WS.
3. Dimensionality Reduction
   - UMAP
     - `Clustering_a_UMAP_reduced_sample_with_DBSCAN_or_HDBSCAN_with_scoring.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook for clustering a UMAP reduced sample with DBSCAN or HDBSCAN with scoring.
   - t-SNE
     - `Clustering_a_t-SNE_reduced_sample_with_DBSCAN_or_HDBSCAN_with_scoring.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook for clustering a t-SNE reduced sample with DBSCAN or HDBSCAN with scoring.
