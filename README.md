# MPhys-Project-2024-2025

## Project Purpose

This project is part of my MPhys degree and includes various codes developed during my research. The project is divided into two main sections: The code and the supplementary directory.

## Project Code Structure

The project is organised into the following directories:

### Supervised

This directory contains codes related to supervised learning methods. Each code has its own ReadMe file explaining its purpose and functionality.

### Unsupervised

This directory contains codes related to unsupervised learning methods. Each code has its own ReadMe file explaining its purpose and functionality.

## Supplementary 

This directory is split into two main directories that contain some of the work I have achieved in my MPhys project.

## Semester 1

This directory contains a flowchart that I made for the data and things I was considering in Semester 1.

## Semester 2

This directory contains PDFs of the weekly meeting slides I made especially for each of the meetings with my supervisor. There are a few missing because I initally started deleting them and just replacing figures, but the majority of the work is there.
