# MPhys-Project-2024-2025

## Project Purpose

This project is part of my MPhys degree and includes various codes developed during my research. The project is divided into two main sections: Supervised and Unsupervised.

## Project Structure

The project is organized into the following directories:

### Supervised

This directory contains codes related to supervised learning methods. Each code has its own ReadMe file explaining its purpose and functionality.

#### 2D Mass Fits Loops for Significance Scan

This directory contains the code for performing 2D mass fits while looping over the cuts of the BDT response. The purpose of this code is to scan for significance in the 2D mass fits.

#### 1D Mass Fits

This directory contains the code for performing 1D mass fits. The purpose of this code is to fit the mass distributions in 1D for different samples.

#### 2D Mass Fits

This directory contains the code for performing 2D mass fits. The purpose of this code is to fit the mass distributions in 2D for different samples.

### Unsupervised

This directory contains codes related to unsupervised learning methods. Each code has its own ReadMe file explaining its purpose and functionality.

#### HDBSCAN

This directory contains the code for performing HDBSCAN clustering on a reference sample (RS) and then applying the centroid of the clusters to a working sample (WS).

#### DBSCAN

This directory contains the code for performing DBSCAN clustering on a reference sample (RS) and then applying the centroid of the clusters to a working sample (WS).

#### Dimensionality Reduction

This directory contains codes related to dimensionality reduction techniques. It includes the following subdirectories:

##### UMAP

This directory contains the code for clustering a UMAP reduced sample with DBSCAN or HDBSCAN with scoring.

##### t-SNE

This directory contains the code for clustering a t-SNE reduced sample with DBSCAN or HDBSCAN with scoring.
