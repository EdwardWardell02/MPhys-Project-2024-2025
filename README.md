# MPhys-Project-2024-2025

## Project Purpose

This project is part of my MPhys degree and includes various codes developed during my research. The project is divided into two main sections: Supervised and Unsupervised.

## Project Structure

The project is organized into the following directories:

### Supervised

This directory contains codes related to supervised learning methods. Each code has its own ReadMe file explaining its purpose and functionality.

### Unsupervised

This directory contains codes related to unsupervised learning methods. Each code has its own ReadMe file explaining its purpose and functionality.
